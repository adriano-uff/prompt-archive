I will first review the provided YAML and CSV files to understand the API structure and the specified test cases. Then, I will generate the necessary test cases using KarateDSL.

Let's start by examining the contents of the files.

### Step 1: Read the Files
I'll load and inspect the contents of the uploaded YAML and CSV files.

The YAML file describes an OpenAPI specification for a Petstore API, detailing various endpoints, request methods, and response status codes. The CSV file contains the specific test cases to be generated, formatted as endpoint, HTTP method, and status code.

### Step 2: Generate KarateDSL Test Cases

I will now create the KarateDSL test cases based on the information from the CSV file and the YAML specification. The resulting test cases will be saved into a single file as requested.

Here is an example structure of the KarateDSL test case for an endpoint:

```karate
Feature: API Test Cases

  Scenario: Test case description
    Given url 'http://localhost:8080/api/v3/'
    And path '<endpoint>'
    When method <HTTP_METHOD>
    Then status <STATUS_CODE>
```

I will iterate over each row in the CSV file to generate the corresponding KarateDSL test case.

### Step 3: Generate the KarateDSL File
I'll proceed with generating the test cases and save them into a single file.

The KarateDSL test cases have been successfully generated and saved to a file. You can download the file using the link below:
